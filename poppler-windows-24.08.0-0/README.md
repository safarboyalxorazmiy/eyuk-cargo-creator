You can download the latest build from [releases](https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/latest).

## What is this?
Please note that the purpose of this repository is solely to download the compiled poppler binaries from conda-forge poppler-feedstock and put everything in a nice zip for use. This repository does not build poppler. If you belive you have an issue with poppler itself, or the building of it, please direct those issue to the feedstock or the guys over at [poppler-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/poppler-feedstock).

## Out of Date?

- Ensure that [poppler-feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/poppler-feedstock) is up to date. 

- Create a new pull request and bump `POPPLER_VERSION` in `package.sh` to the latest.  

- Sometimes the feedstock does an update on the same version in order to apply a fix and we need to do a repackage here. If the version has been packaged already, increase the build number by 1 in `package.sh`. If it has not been packaged yet, reset the build number to 0.

- After merged the tag will be matched and the workflow will trigger a new release.

### Poppler-data out of date?

- Copy the latest download link for poppler-data from the [offical poppler site](https://poppler.freedesktop.org/).

- Create a new pull request and update the `POPPLER_DATA_URL` under in `package.sh`. 

- Sometimes the feedstock does an update on the same version in order to apply a fix and we need to do a repackage here. If the version has been packaged already, increase the build number by 1 in `package.sh`. If it has not been packaged yet, reset the build number to 0.

- After merged the tag will be matched and the workflow will trigger a new release.
